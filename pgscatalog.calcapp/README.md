A CLI application that can:

* aggregate PGS calculated with `plink2 --score` that are split across multiple files (e.g. per chromosome)
* estimate [genetic ancestry similarity and adjust calculated PGS](https://pgsc-calc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanation/geneticancestry.html)

The [PGS Catalog Calculator](https://github.com/PGScatalog/pgsc_calc) uses this CLI application internally.
