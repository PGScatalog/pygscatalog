This repository contains Python applications and libraries for working with polygenic scores (PGS :dna:) and the 
[PGS Catalog](https://www.pgscatalog.org/), an open database of polygenic scores and the relevant metadata required for 
accurate application and evaluation. It is based on a previous codebase of utilities ([pgscatalog_utils](https://github.com/PGScatalog/pgscatalog_utils)) 
that has been converted to namespace packages for modularity and re-use.

## User applications 

[![install with bioconda](https://img.shields.io/badge/install%20with-bioconda-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/pgscatalog-utils/README.html)
[![install with pypi](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/pgscatalog-utils)](https://pypi.org/project/pgscatalog-utils/)

These CLI applications are used internally by the [PGS Catalog Calculator (`pgsc_calc`)](https://github.com/PGScatalog/pgsc_calc) 
workflow for calculating PGS and performing common adjustments for genetic ancestry. 

If you want an automatic method of calculating PGS, including genetic ancestry similarity estimation and PGS normalisation, 
the workflow is the easiest method.

> [!TIP]
> If you want to use all of the applications listed below, you can install the package `pgscatalog-utils` with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pgscatalog-utils/) or [bioconda](http://bioconda.github.io/recipes/pgscatalog-utils/README.html)

## Credits & Licence

`pygscatalog`(_aka_ `pgscatalog_utils`) is developed as part of the [PGS Catalog](https://www.pgscatalog.org/) project, a
collaboration between the University of Cambridge’s Department of Public Health and Primary Care (Michael Inouye, 
Samuel Lambert) and the European Bioinformatics Institute (Helen Parkinson, Laura Harris).

This package contains code libraries and apps for working with PGS Catalog data and calculating PGS within the 
[PGS Catalog Calculator (`pgsc_calc`)](https://github.com/PGScatalog/pgsc_calc) workflow, and is based on an earlier 
codebase ([pgscatalog_utils](https://github.com/PGScatalog/pgscatalog_utils)) with contributions and input from members 
of the PGS Catalog team (Samuel Lambert, Benjamin Wingfield, Aoife McMahon Laurent Gil) and Inouye lab 
(Rodrigo Canovas, Scott Ritchie, Jingqin Wu).
