This Python library contains classes and functions useful for aggregating and adjusting calculated PGS in the context of genetic ancestry similarity.

The library is used by the CLI applications in this repository. If you want to write Python code to work with PGS data, it may be helpful for you too.

Please note this package doesn't contain functionality to calculate a PGS from target genomes and scoring files . Instead, it's focused on aggregation and normalisation. 

## Installation 

```
$ pip install pgscatalog-calclib
```
